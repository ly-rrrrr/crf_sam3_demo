Please observe the following consecutive video frames.
The object marked by the mask is the **protagonist** (focus subject), while everything outside the mask is the background/context.

**Referring Expression:** "{referring_expression}"

**Question:** Does the masked protagonist exactly match the referring expression?

> **IMPORTANT:** Use systematic step-by-step verification to ensure accuracy.

## STEP 1: CONDITION DECOMPOSITION (Based on Text Only)

> ⚠️ **CRITICAL:** Decompose PURELY based on the TEXT - ignore what you see in frames at this stage!

* Break down the expression into simple, atomic conditions
* Each condition describes ONE constraint (color, location, action, size, etc.)
* Keep the category noun in each condition for clarity
* Extract ALL attributes and constraints mentioned in the text
* **DO NOT** drop any condition because you think it won't match the video

### Decomposition Examples (text-only analysis):
* `"black rabbit eating"` → `["black rabbit", "rabbit eating"]`
* `"Kitten moving around playing"` → `["kitten moving around", "kitten playing"]`
* `"white dog on the left"` → `["white dog", "dog on the left"]`
* `"The trainer on the left, directing the bear's hula hoop performance"` → `["trainer on the left", "trainer directing the bear"]`
* `"Monkeys on the left sitting down without moving"` → `["monkeys on the left", "monkeys sitting down", "monkeys without moving"]`

### ⚠️ Common mistake to AVOID:
* ❌ Seeing only white rabbits in video → incorrectly dropping "black" from conditions
* ✓ Text says "black rabbit" → MUST include "black rabbit" as a condition regardless of what's in video

**Sub-conditions for "{referring_expression}":**

## STEP 2: VERIFY EACH SUB-CONDITION INDEPENDENTLY

Verify each sub-condition independently:

**Condition 1: [Condition content]**
* **Observation:** [What the protagonist actually shows in the video frames]
* **Verification:** ✓ Satisfied / ✗ Not Satisfied / ? Uncertain

**Condition 2: [Condition content]**
* **Observation:** [What the protagonist actually shows in the video frames]
* **Verification:** ✓ Satisfied / ✗ Not Satisfied / ? Uncertain

**Condition 3: [Condition content]**
* **Observation:** [What the protagonist actually shows in the video frames]
* **Verification:** ✓ Satisfied / ✗ Not Satisfied / ? Uncertain

*[Continue for all conditions...]*

---

## STEP 3: COMPREHENSIVE JUDGMENT (FINAL JUDGMENT)

### Statistical Summary:
* Total conditions: **N** = [number]
* Satisfied: **M** = [number]
* Not satisfied: **F** = [number]
* Uncertain: **U** = [number]

### Definitions:

**Core Condition Definition:**
* Category name (e.g., "rabbit", "person", "elephant")
* Primary action (e.g., "eating", "walking", "directing")
* Key location attribute (e.g., "on the left", "in the corner")

**Minor Condition Definition:**
* Detail descriptions (e.g., shade of color, relative size)
* Modifying states (e.g., "slowly", "carefully")

### Decision Rules:

**1. "Yes" (Perfect Match):**
* All conditions satisfied (`M = N`)
* **OR:** All core conditions satisfied + at most 1 minor condition uncertain (all core ✓ **AND** `U ≤ 1` AND only minor)

**2. "Partial" (Near Match):**
* Core conditions satisfied, only 1-2 minor conditions not satisfied or uncertain (all core ✓ **AND** `F ≤ 2` AND only minor)
* **OR:** 1 core condition uncertain, rest all satisfied (1 core ? **AND** rest ✓)

**3. "No" (Mismatch):**
* Any core condition not satisfied (any core ✗)
* **OR:** Multiple conditions not satisfied (`F ≥ 3`)
* **OR:** Multiple core conditions uncertain (core ? `≥ 2`)

## FINAL ANSWER

Answer with one word only: **Yes**, **Partial**, or **No**.
